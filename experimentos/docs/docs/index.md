# Loan Default Prediction Experiments

Welcome to the documentation for the Loan Default Prediction experiments project. This project aims to provide a robust and scalable framework for training and analyzing machine learning models for loan default prediction.

## Project Overview

This project is structured as a series of experiments to evaluate different models and techniques for predicting loan defaults. It uses a pipeline-based architecture to ensure reproducibility and maintainability.

### Key Features

- **Pipeline Architecture**: Modular pipelines for data processing, feature extraction, training, and analysis.
- **Dependency Injection**: Uses `dependency-injector` for flexible service management.
- **Unified Storage**: Abstracted storage layer supporting local filesystem, AWS S3, and Google Cloud Storage.
- **CLI Driven**: Comprehensive command-line interface for managing the entire lifecycle.
- **Reproducibility**: Versioned models and datasets.
